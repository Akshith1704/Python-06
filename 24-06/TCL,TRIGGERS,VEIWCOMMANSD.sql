-- TCL (Transaction control language) Commands
/*
TCL commands are used to manage transactions, maintain ACID properties, and control the flow of data modifications.
TCL commands ensure the consistency and durability of data in a database.
For example, if an operation fails during a transaction, the transaction is rolled back.
When a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if the system fails or restarts.
TCL commands also ensure that all operations within a transaction are executed as a single unit.
*/

-- commit
/*
Commit: Saves a transaction to the database
*/
commit;
-- rollback
/*
Rollback: Undoes a transaction or change that hasn't been saved to the database
*/
rollback;

-- savepoint
/*
Savepoint: Temporarily saves a transaction for later rollback 
*/
savepoint a;
-- here it will store that as a
-- after we can call that by rollback to a
rollback to a;

-- any operation performed on table using dml
-- insert,delete,update every command is transaction 

/*
In mysql it is having auto commit so is doesnot make anysense transaction commands in mysql
for this we have to use command start transaction
*/

-- Triggers 

-- Trigger is a statement that a system executes automatically when there is any modification to the database
-- Triggers are used to specify certain integrity constraints and referential constraints that cannot be specified using the constraint mechanism of SQL

-- Trigers are 6 types 
/*
1)after insert -- activated after data is inserted into the table.
2)after update -- activated after data in the table is modified. 
3)after delete -- activated after data is deleted/removed from the table. 
4)before insert -- activated before data is inserted into the table. 
5)before update -- activated before data in the table is modified.
6)before delete --  activated before data is deleted/removed from the table.
